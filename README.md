Welcome to my website! 

[lyonelz96.github.io](https://lyonelz96.github.io)

You will find some of the cool projects I have worked on or am working on in here.

This website will always be a WIP and I will continue to modify it to better suit my needs.
One of my goals is to eventually add a section for any Music projects I'm working on as well as **maybe** write some educational blog posts on programming, design patterns, music theory, music composition, videogames and many more topics!

At the bottom of the website you will find ways you can contact me! I'll leave some of them here aswell, for convenience.
